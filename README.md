### Project Review by Hannah 19/05/23
#### Possible fixes
- Some indentation has been used on the staff-profile.html however this should be implemented throughout
- ensure only the title, meta tags and stylesheet links are included in the head. nav and other visable content should be in the body
- comments should be used throughout HTML and CSS
- HTML is supposed to describe what is happening on the page, therefore, a table is incorrect use for a nav bar.
  Try styling an unordered list instead <ul> <li> </li> </ul>
 -image file names could be simplified to make them easy to identify in the code
 - I think the /Images/logo.png is a broken image because there is no Images folder
 - unused files should be removed e.g. contact.txt
 - Best practice to include most CSS in the CSS file
 - over use of center tags, try using text-align: center; in the CSS
